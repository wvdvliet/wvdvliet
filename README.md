I am currently working on a thesis project in at the Gemeente Amsterdam (municipality) to use LiDAR and Panorama camera sensor fusion to improve the level of detail of the digital 3D model of the city. This helps with disaster planning, city zoning and quality of life considerations. Im still relatively new to coding, but I'm excited to be learning through such an exciting project!
